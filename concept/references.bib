Further symbolism is introduced to take care of branching filaments as well. Two entirely different models are constructed for a particular branching organism, resembling one of the red algae. These models are compared with reference to the number of states employed, and the presence or absence of instructions for unequal divisions and for inductive relationships among the cells. The importance of a morphogenetic control theory concerning these relationships is emphasized.},

We show that, on a range of problems, {GP} can automatically generate new {PSO} algorithms that outperform standard human-generated as well as some previously evolved ones.},

	abstract = {Among living tetrapods, salamanders are regarded as most closely resembling the first terrestrial vertebrates, and are therefore an interesting group in which the evolutionary changes in the locomotor behaviour from aquatic to terrestrial habitats can be inferred. Salamanders exhibit two locomotor modes: swimming and terrestrial stepping. The swimming is anguilliform and resembles closely that of the lamprey. On the ground, the salamander switches to a stepping gait with axial undulations that is also observed in many reptiles. The salamander is therefore ideally suited for examining the neural mechanisms for the generation of these two locomotor modes, as well as the neural mechanisms of gait transition. In the present paper, we describe the kinematics and patterns of activation of axial and limb muscles during stepping and swimming in adult salamanders. We then review the current neurobiological data about the organisation of the spinal networks underlying swimming and stepping, and the mechanisms of gait transition. Finally we report modelling studies aimed at understanding the organisation and operation of the salamander locomotor circuits. Altogether, the neurobiological and the modelling data support the hypothesis of a phylogenetic conservatism from agnathians to amphibians of the spinal locomotor networks generating axial motor patterns.},

We present a spinal cord model and its implementation in an amphibious salamander robot that demonstrates how a primitive neural circuit for swimming can be extended by phylogenetically more recent limb oscillatory centers to explain the ability of salamanders to switch between swimming and walking. The model suggests neural mechanisms for modulation of velocity, direction, and type of gait that are relevant for all tetrapods. It predicts that limb oscillatory centers have lower intrinsic frequencies than body oscillatory centers, and we present biological data supporting this.},

depiction is developed, which describes the system completely. These
analyses lead to a generalized model of the algorithm, containing a set
of coefficients to control the system's convergence tendencies. Some
results of the particle swarm optimizer, implementing modifications
derived from the analysis, suggest methods for altering the original
algorithm in ways that eliminate problems and increase the ability of
the particle swarm to find optima of some well-studied test functions},
